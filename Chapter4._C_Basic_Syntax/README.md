# Chapter 4. C Basic Syntax

```text
This chapter will give details about all the basic syntax about C programming language including tokens, keywords, identifiers, etc.
```

You have seen a basic structure of C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.

## Tokens in C

A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens:

```c
printf("Hello World! \n");
```

The individual tokens are:

```c
printf
(
"Hello, World! \n"
)
;
```

## Semicolons

In C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.

For example, following are two different statements:

```c
printf("Hello World!\n");
return 0;
```

## Comments

Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler.

```c
// My first program in C
```

You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.

## Identifiers

## Keywords

## Whitespace in C
